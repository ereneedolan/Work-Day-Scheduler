## Description

I created this project to practice using JQUERY, moment.js to work on an interactive calendar for the user to enter events. My motivation was to make an easy tool for an user to be able to tell the current hour, what is upcoming and an easy way for them to schedule events. To make the execution even more user friendly the time blocks are color coded to show past hours, the current hour and the upcoming hours to make the scheduling experience easy.
